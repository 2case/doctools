Next Steps
==========

This is the end of the Getting Started Tutorial. You now have a first 
impression of what a FLOW3 application looks like and how the most important
modules of FLOW3 work together.

You now have two options for delving further into FLOW3 programming:

	-	Start completing the missing functionality on your own and while you
		do, read further parts of the FLOW3 reference manual
	-	Install the finished blog example and explore its code by reading and
		modifying it

If you can't wait to see the finished blog example all you need to do is:
    
	-	Delete everything within your blog package (that is everything below
		*Packages/Application/TYPO3.Blog/*)
	-	Copy everything from 
		*Packages/Application/TYPO3.GettingStarted/Resources/Private/CheatSheet/
		to the *Blog* package directory
