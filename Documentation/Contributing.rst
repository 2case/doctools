Contributing to Documentation
=============================

A complex system like ours needs a lot of documentation. And despite the
complexity that documentation should be easy and fun to read. Right?

* *Tasks:* Proof read existing documentation, writing new documentation
* *Skills needed:* Writing skills and very good english are a must

Follow the these simple steps to get started:

#. Checkout the corresponding package containting the documentation with Git,
	and set up the git repository so you can contribute:

	.. code-block:: bash

		$ git clone git://git.typo3.org/FLOW3/Documentation.git
		$ # set up git so you can push to Gerrit

	If you do not know how to set up Git correctly, follow the easy steps of
	`our git wizard <http://www.wwwision.de/githelper/#FLOW3/Documentation.git>`_.

#. Install Sphinx to render the documentation. For that, follow the instructions in
	the this documentation

#. Read the documentation and adjust it as needed.

#. push it to gerrit, or alternatively upload a patch with the changes to the
	`Forge Issue Tracker <http://forge.typo3.org/projects/flow3-distribution-base/issues>`_
